msgid ""
"The charts are intended to provide a simple way to compare the evolution "

"      in pairs of countries that are in different stages of the epidemic."
" We use the reported\n"
"      deaths to align the data of both countries, which allows presenting"
" them as if they were at the same\n"
"      stage of the epidemic. For example, the chart below compares Brazil"
" and Italy. When it\n"
"      was created, Italy was about 28 days ahead of Brazil in terms of "
"the epidemic's\n"
"      progression. Brazil's line (blue) crosses Italy's line (red) at "
"around 1,000 deaths.\n"
"      Judging by the trends of the death lines, Brazil is expected to "
"experience a less severe\n"
"      growth in deaths than Italy did in the same time period after the "
"disease's arrival. However, always be careful about drawing conclusions\n"
"      based on these trends. The epidemic's dynamic is always changing. "
"Different\n"

#~ "The charts are intended to provide "
#~ "a simple way to compare the "
#~ "evolution of COVID-19\n"
#~ "      in pairs of countries that "
#~ "are in different stages of the "
#~ "epidemic. We use the reported\n"
#~ "      deaths to align the data of"
#~ " both countries, presenting them as "
#~ "if they were at the same\n"
#~ "      stage of the epidemic. For "
#~ "example, the image below compares Brazil"
#~ " and Italy. When the\n"
#~ "      chart was created, Italy was "
#~ "about 28 days ahead of Brazil in"
#~ " terms of progression of\n"
#~ "      the epidemic. The brazilian line"
#~ " (blue) crosses Italy's line at "

#~ "      Judging by the trends of the"
#~ " death lines, Brazil is expected to"
